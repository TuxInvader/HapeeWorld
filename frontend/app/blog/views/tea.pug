      | Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia
      | which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.

    p 
      |Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of Camellia taliensis. After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
      | There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes.
      | Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.
