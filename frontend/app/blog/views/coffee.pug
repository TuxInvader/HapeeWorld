      | Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, 
      | primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks

    p
      | The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. 
      | The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. 
      | It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, 
      | French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter 
      | taste or enhance the flavor.
